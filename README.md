## Installation

### Deps

`git & bash`

To install this, simply do the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/jeebuscrossaint/ldir
cd ldir
./install
```

## Usage

The script can be used anywhere, even a tty, therefore just run `ldir [arg]` where `[arg]` is a folder you want to specify the tree of. If no args are passed then the script will just use the current working directory as the argument.

## License

I use the MIT License for all my projects as they are the license that out of the box provided by github just says `i do not care.`
